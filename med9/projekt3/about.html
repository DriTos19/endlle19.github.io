<h1> About me </h1>
</header>
<p class="l"> I'm a 15 year old kid that really loves bikes. I live in Shkoder. I opened this shop for the sole reason of creating an inseperable bike community that can enjoy bikes by not taking the risk of emporting them. My hobbies are playing volleyball. I watch a lot of bike videos and with time I have learned how to build a bike in theory. It is my dream to turn this small shop worldwide and I hope that you can be a part of it</p>
